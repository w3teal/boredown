# boredown

Simply writing and make site in Markdown without feel stupid for just knowing basic. **+ It's has perfect Lighthouse score!**  
**Just knowing Markdown?** Yeah, just write with it without any complicating features. **Knowing HTML?** Create the template become what you want. **Knowing Javascript?** Change anything what you want. **Knowing ChatGPT?** Ask him.

Boredown was fully using [Marked.js](https://marked.js.org/) for rendering all markdown-styled text like **bold**, _italic_, ~~striked~~. If you're a mad at math, than you're in good company. With Boredown, you can write math by [KaTeX](https://katex.org/).

Boredown.js has the same concept like [TeXMe.js](https://github.com/susam/texme), rendering markdown with the contents in HTML and also supporting math.  
Boredown.js prioritize performance and appearance. Instead use MathJax, Boredown using KaTeX for getting an lighter render.
